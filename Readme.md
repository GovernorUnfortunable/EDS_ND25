# Data in a Changing Planet: environmental data and sustainability (ND Spring 25)
## _Visual Representation of Concepts for the class_ 

This repository contains different visual graphs representing the interconnected objects, technologies, concepts, and examples explored throughout the _Data in a Changing Planet: Environmental Data and Sustainability course_, for the Spring 2025. The objective is to have a useful representation of objects, concepts, and relations that allows us to bring forward the complexity of the issues discussed in class. It also brings together pieces we have discussed separately in different passages of our class so that socio-technical processes supporting environmental data production and use can be better understood. 

**Purpose:**

This visual aid aims to:
* Provide a holistic overview of some of the topics covered in the course.
* Highlight the relationships and dependencies between different social and technical elements. 
* Serve as a dynamic resource that evolves as we progress through the semester. 
* Facilitate a deeper understanding of the course material through visual connections and synthesis. 

**Formats:**
* `.svg`: these are editable graphs (you can use draw.io or [inkscape](https://inkscape.en.softonic.com/mac) to edit these files.
* `.png`: these files are not editable, but they are easy to visualize with many built-in applications on PCs and Macs. 

**How to Use:**

* **View the Graph:** open the `.svg` or `.png` file in your web browser to see the visual representation of specific aspects of the course. 
* **Explore Connections:** Examine the lines and arrows connecting different elements to understand how they relate to each other. You can also see green cloud-like elements that relate specific pieces of the graph to the contents in our modules. 
* **Stay Updated:** This graph will be updated periodically to reflect new topics and connections as we move through the semester. Be sure to check for new commits to see the latest version. You can use the commenting to suggest changes or additions. 

**Contributing and Providing Feedback:**

Your input is valuable in making this resource as effective as possible! Please feel free to contribute in the following ways:

* **Report Issues:** If you notice any errors, omissions, or areas for improvement in the graph, please open a new "Issue" in this repository. Clearly describe the issue and, if possible, suggest a correction or the thing that you would like the graph to represent.
* **Suggest Additions:** As we cover new material, you might see new connections or concepts that could be added to the graph. Feel free to suggest these through issues as well.
* **Participate in Discussions:** Use the issue tracker to discuss potential improvements and provide your perspectives on the visual representation.

**Software Used:**

* [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com): For creating and editing the graph.
